XTW100 is a SPI NOR flash programmer made in China. I create this project
to make using free software on this programmer possible.

Since stm32-vserprog (https://github.com/dword1511/stm32-vserprog) supports this flash programmer, this project is deprecated. You should now flash the stm32-vserprog firmware to XTW100 and use flashrom to operate the programmer.
